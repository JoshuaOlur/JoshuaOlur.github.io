                    <h2>Wetlands</h2>
                    <p>A wetland refers to a land area saturated with water, where vegetation capable of thriving in wet conditions and low oxygen levels at their roots predominates. Coastal wetlands encompass all such areas within coastal watersheds, covering the entirety of land from which tidal streams flow into the ocean or inland seas.</p>

                    <h2>River</h2>
                    <p>Rivers exhibit three distinct habitat zones: the riverbed, which comprises the water channel itself; the riparian zone along the riverbanks, encompassing the land, trees, and water-dependent flora and fauna; and the floodplains, which are the flat, low-lying areas extending from the river channel.</p>

                    <h2>Coral Reef</h2>
                    <p>In tropical regions with warm waters, coral reefs undergo gradual growth, developing their vivid structures over extended periods spanning hundreds to thousands of years. These bustling underwater ecosystems serve as vital habitats, offering sustenance and refuge to a myriad of marine life, including fish, sea turtles, crustaceans, and various invertebrates. Thus, coral reefs stand out as among the most diverse and vibrant ecosystems on our planet.</p>

                    <h2>Ocean</h2>
                    <p>The marine environment encompasses over fifty percent of the Earth's surface and comprises numerous distinct habitats. The majority of marine flora and fauna inhabit the euphotic zone, which is the upper layer of the ocean where sunlight penetrates, providing warmth and facilitating the growth of plants while enabling them to produce oxygen.</p>
